         <h1 class="page-header">AssertJ Core overview</h1>

         <p>AssertJ core is a Java library that provides a fluent interface for writing assertions. Its main goal is to
            improve test code readability and make maintenance of tests easier.<br>
            AssertJ core provides assertions for JDK standard types, it requires Java SE 6.0 or later and can be used with either
            JUnit or TestNG.
         </p>

         <p>AssertJ core <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core">code</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues?state=open">issue tracker</a> are hosted on github.
         </p>

         <h3 class="page-header">Getting started</h3>

         <p>To get quickly started, just have a look at our
            <a href="assertj-core-quick-start.html">one minute starting guide</a>.
         </p>

         <p>Convert your existing JUnit assertions to AssertJ ones : we have a <a href="assertj-core-converting-junit-assertions-to-assertj.html">guide</a> to easily
            convert JUnit assertions to AssertJ, we plan to write a maven plugin to do automate this conversion task.
         </p>

         <p>Migrating from Fest ? check our migration guide and don't worry, migration is not hard:
         <ul>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-migrating-from-fest.html">Migrating from Fest 2.x</a></li>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-migrating-from-fest.html#fest-1.4">Migrating from Fest 1.4</a></li>
         </ul>

         <p>AssertJ core javadoc is published
            <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/core/api/index.html">here</a>.</p>

         <p>If you have any questions, please use
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/assertj">AssertJ google group</a>.</p>

         <p>You are more than welcome to
            <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues?state=open">file a ticket</a> if you need new assertions or see potential improvements.
         </p>

         <h3 class="page-header">Working with AssertJ core</h3>

         <h5>Working with AssertJ on a daily basis</h5>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-quick-start.html">Quick start guide</a></li>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-features-highlight.html">Features highlight</a></li>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-news.html">New and noteworthy in AssertJ core</a></li>
         </ul>

         <h5>Extending AssertJ</h5>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-conditions.html">Extending assertions with condition</a></li>
            <li><a href="assertj-core-custom-assertions.html">Creating your own specific assertions</a></li>
         </ul>

         <p>You can see assertions in action with <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/blob/master/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples/">assertj examples tests</a> from <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/">assertj-examples</a> project.</p>

         <p>Although AssertJ core can be used with Android, I suggest to use
            <a href="http://square.github.io/fest-android/">Fest assertions for Android</a>, a very useful library for Android developpers.
         </p>

         <h3 class="page-header"><span id="fork"></span>Why having forked Fest Assert ?</h3>

         <p>AssertJ is a fork of FEST Assert a great project I have contributed to during 3 years, so why having forked it ?</p>

         <p>Well there are two main reasons :</p>
         <ul>
            <li>FEST 2.0 will only provide a limited set of assertions, far less than Fest 2.0M10 and even less than
               FEST 1.x.
            </li>
            <li>FEST is not enough open to users demands and contributions.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>On the contrary
            <em>AssertJ goal is to provide a rich set of assertions</em> and any resonable requests to enrich AssertJ assertions is welcome as we know it will be useful to someone. Said otherwise, AssertJ is
            <em>community driven</em>, we listen to our users since AssertJ is built for them.</p>

         <p>If you feel that some assertion is missing, please <a href="https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues?state=open">fill a ticket</a>
            or even better make a contribution !
