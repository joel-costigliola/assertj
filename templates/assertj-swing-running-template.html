         <p>GUI tests, by nature, are slower and more intrusive than regular unit tests. This section provides
            some practical advices.</p>

         <h2>Interrupting running tests</h2>
         <p>$assertj_swing_name provides support for killing an already running test suite.</p>

               Let's say you're running a pretty big FEST-Swing test, one that takes a couple minutes to run. In the
               middle of it, a Skype call comes in. You need to answer the call, but you currently don't own the mouse!
               Eventually, some frantic combination of Alt, Ctrl, Cmd, Tab, Esc, F1-12, gets the window buried, and you
               can accept the call, but you want something more "decisive" to kill the test run.

         <p>The <code>EmergencyAbortListener</code> implements this feature. After registering this listener in your
            test, you can terminate your test using the key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
            <kbd>A</kbd>.</p>
         <pre><code class="language-java">private EmergencyAbortListener listener;

@BeforeMethod public void setUp() {
  listener = EmergencyAbortListener.registerInToolkit();
  // set up your test fixture.
}

@AfterMethod public void tearDown() {
  listener.unregister();
  // clean up resources.
}</code></pre>

         <p>The key combination can be configured too:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-java">listener = EmergencyAbortListener.registerInToolkit()
                                 .keyCombination(key(VK_C).modifiers(SHIFT_MASK));
</code></pre>

         <p>$assertj_swing_name tests can be executed in a Continuous Integration (CI) server. The following are
            tips to run and troubleshoot $assertj_swing_name tests in CI servers, in different environments.</p>

                  <p>
                  In order to get the most value from an automated GUI testing tool like FEST-Swing [or
                  $assertj_swing_name], you'll want to have the ability to run your full suite of tests frequently.
                  Doing so on your personal desktop can be very time consuming, as you must largely sit and watch
                  while the tests run. If everything goes as planned, your tests will all pass and you need not have
                  been watching it at all. If you're already running a CI (Continuous Integration) server like me
                  (Hudson is my favorite), then the natural thing to do is run your GUI tests as part of your CI
                  process. Even if you're not running a CI server, you would stand to benefit from not being forced t
                  o watch your tests run every time.
                  </p><p>
                  If you're running Linux, BSD, or any *NIX style operating system chances are that CI server probably
                  doesn't even have X running, so how are you to run your GUI tests?
                  </p>

         <p>
            <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/" target="_blank">TightVNC</a> is the answer (or any other vnc server
            you could think of). It creates a desktop that you can access via a vnc viewer locally and even
            remotely. We are using TightVNC for running the tests of $assertj_swing_name, too. If you're running Ubuntu
            or Debian, simply <code>sudo apt-get (or aptitude) install tightvncserver</code>. For other distributions
            (or OS) follow their normal process for installing packages.</p>

         <p>
            Once installed, the process is to start the vnc server, run the tests and then kill the vnc server. Since
            this could be done by an ape, we're using a
            <a href="https://github.com/croesch/beefiles/blob/master/src/execute-on-vnc.sh" target="_blank">script</a>
            to perform all these steps automatically:
         </p>
         <pre><code class="language-bash">execute-on-vnc.sh mvn test</code></pre>

         <p>
            This
            <ol>
               <li>starts a local vnc server at display 42</li>
               <li>sets the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable</li>
               <li>executes <code>mvn test</code></li>
               <li>restores the previous <code>DISPLAY</code> value</li>
               <li>stops the vnc server</li>
            </ol>
            The script makes it easy to start an application (e.g. tests) <em>in the background</em>, without
            disrupting your desktop. If you need to access it remotely or to run multiple applications (e.g. tests),
            you'll have to adapt the script to your needs.
         </p>

               Why don't we just use <code>xvfb-run</code>? Our tests maximize windows and do other stuff the default
               window manager of <code>xvfb</code> doesn't support. TightVNC makes it easy to use another window
               manager. Just add <code>gnome-wm &</code> (or the window manager of your choice) to
               <code>~/.vnc/xstartup</code> and you're ready to run.

            <p>Hopefully this simple idea will help free your desktop (and you) from spending time watching
            $assertj_swing_name work its magic.</p>

         <h3>Hudson under Windows</h3>
         <p><em>by Uli Schrempp (written for FEST)</em></p>

         <p>As we develop software with the target platform Windows, we need to run the tests on Windows platform too.
            So the X-Server approach does not fit. Here are two solutions:</p>

         <h4>Running Hudson service in interactive mode</h4>
         <p>Open the service properties dialog of the Hudson service. Select in the <em>Log On</em> tab <em>Run as
            Local System account</em> and check the <em>Allow service to interact with desktop</em>.</p>

         <p>This works fine, but when the Hudson system needs to access some shares in the network, then the Local
            System account might not have the appropriate permissions.</p>

         <h4>Running Hudson as application via JNLP</h4>
         <p>Here is the challenge to automatically start the Hudson agent via command-line after a restart. Here's a
            short recipe:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Configure auto-logon in Windows registry. Set the following keys<ul>
               <li><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\AutoAdminLogon=1</code></li>
               <li><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultUserName=testuser</code></li>
               <li><code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultPassword=secret</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Start Hudson agent on start-up<ul>
               <li>Create a batch file to start Hudson
                  <pre><code class="language-bash">javaws http://HUDSON_MASTER/computer/COMPUTERNAME/slave-agent.jnlp</code></pre>
               </li>
               <li>Add this batch file to the start-up folder</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Add remote control support for this machine<ul>
               <li>Create some scheduled tasks to start and stop Hudson and disable them</li>
               <li>So the Hudson master node can call trigger the agent node remotely via command-line</li>
            </ul></li>
         </ol>

         <h4>Remote Desktop Issue</h4>
         <p>Sometimes when there was a remote-desktop connection to this machine running Hudson in application mode,
            the Windows session seems to be closed and then the tests could not start the application. Solution for
            that is using VNC.</p>

         <h3>Troubleshooting TeamCity under Windows</h3>
         <p>The following tips are the result of <a
               href="http://groups.google.com/group/easytesting/browse_frm/thread/923077e05f4fec63" target="_blank">this
               thread</a> in the mailing list. Many thanks to (in alphabetical order)</p>
         <ul>

            <li>Eric Kolotyluk</li>
            <li>Peter Murray</li>
         </ul>

         <p>During automated builds</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Make sure there is a desktop running for the build agent</li>
            <li>On Windows, disable Remote Desktop because it can kill the desktop the build agent is using - use VNC
                instead because it won't log you out (if you configure it that way)</li>
            <li>On Windows, use a local user account for the build agent, not a service account</li>
            <li>On Windows, if you launch the build agent with the <code>cmd</code> command use the <code>/k</code>
                option not the <code>/c</code> option - this prevents the command window from closing and orphaning
                the build agent</li>
         </ol>
